    <content>I am SO PROUD of this project and the way we pulled it together in 4 long and intense but wildly fun days. Y’all been asking me to try costuming for forever, and folks HERE IT IS! The folks over at @PUBG MOBILE challenged me to bring their new skin, the Specter Soldier set, to life and they gave me 2 weeks but JOKES ON THEM I am terrible at time management so we did it in 4 days. Click the link in my bio to download PUBG MOBILE and get the Specter Soldier Set now! @PUBGMCREATIVE #ad  PS. A bajillion thanks to Charis and Jason for helping out with the build! #PUBGMOBILE #PUBGMCREATIVE #PUBGMPDP.</content>
