    <content>Build the projects that help you go outside and enjoy life ❤️ my teardrop trailer has taken me so many places I’ve always dreamed of visiting— so far we’ve done 9 national parks and 4,000+ miles together. I’ve climbed so many mountains and ended the day curled up and cozy in my little wooden bean.  My canoe has been to 8 parks and I’ve paddled hundreds of miles on her. And that sailboat? Well, keep your eyes peeled she’s coming soon ;) What’s your dream outdoor project?? (Not that I’m out here stealin’ ideas) (rockets only sort of count. The desert is less pleasant than Yosemite haha)</content>

    <title>Got a bunch of complaints that the launch sequence had music and editing in my full length video- so here’s a far away iphone clip that adds a lot of perspective to the speed and trajectory of Spite! #carbonfiber #rocketry #highpowerrocket </title>
