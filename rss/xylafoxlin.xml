I‚Äôve climbed so many mountains and ended the day curled up and cozy in my little wooden bean.  My canoe has been to 8 parks and I‚Äôve paddled hundreds of miles on her. And that sailboat? Well, keep your eyes peeled she‚Äôs coming soon ;) What‚Äôs your dream outdoor project?? (Not that I‚Äôm out here stealin‚Äô ideas) (rockets only sort of count. The desert is less pleasant than Yosemite haha)</content>
